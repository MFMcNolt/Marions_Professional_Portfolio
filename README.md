# Marion's Incredible Professional Portfolio

## Description

The project was designed to help me solidify the knowledge learnt through the second week of classes about Advanced CSS. The biggest motivator was to ensure I was understandsing how to implement the learnings, especially around Flexbox. 
Building this project has been very enjoyable as it was built to allow me to add the work I create throughout the Bootcamp and literally use it as a Professional Portfolio which I will need to have when entering the 'real world.' Executing this project was a huge learning curb and not only challenged me to ask for help along the way, however, to also study and do my own research with Advanced CSS and how I can continue to grow these skills outside of classes.
